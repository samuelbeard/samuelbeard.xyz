Depending on how savvy you are with the world of web development, there are two distinct sides of the internet for individuals or small companies. The extremely cheap but technical, and the easy and expensive.

In this series of posts, I aim to demistify HOW major parts of the internet work so you can make better, cheaper desisions and not have to rely on expensive services to manage it for you.

# Domain Names
In this part, we will go through what a domain name is, what it is not and how to use it effectively. 

A domain name is the most important part of your web presence (maybe even your business). Once you have found and bought one, make sure you do not let it expire. If you do, it could be bought up by someone else and you'd loose complete control of it.

A domain name is not actually attached to your website or anything else that you have online. It is simply a human readable pointer to wherever your website may be hosted.

## What is a domain name?
### HTTP and HTTPS
### Subdomains
### Second level domain
### TLDs
### Subdirectories and Routes

## Buying a domain name

## Nameservers

## DNS (Domain Name Service)

## Proxies
This is a more advanced part of domain names that is mainly for security.
